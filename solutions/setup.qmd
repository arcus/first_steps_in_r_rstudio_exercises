## Installing Packages

You usually only have to do this once in a Posit.cloud Project (or once on your computer) for a given version of a package. Note the use of quotation marks around the names of packages! 

If you're asked if you want to restart R, that's fine (it kind of doesn't matter either way in our case).

What's the `c()` construct?  That's a **concatenation**, which is a kind of list.  You'll see the use of concatenations frequently in R: `c(1,2,3,10,23)`, `c("apple","banana","canteloupe")`, `c(TRUE, FALSE)`, etc.

```{r}
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "tidyverse"))
```
