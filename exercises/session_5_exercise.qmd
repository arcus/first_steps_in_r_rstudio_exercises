# Putting it All Together

Let's make a report that studies one of the symptoms tracked in the cirrhosis data we've looked at.  For example, maybe you want to work around the symptom of Ascites (that's a discrete symptom), or Cholesterol level (that's a continuous measure).  But you pick one that you are most curious about!

Note that we're not doing research-grade predictive modeling or hypothesis testing... that is outside the scope of this First Steps workshop series.  

This time, the entire Quarto document is "your turn"... so go ahead and create the code chunks you want!  We'll provide some scaffolding.

## Load Libraries and Import Data

Information about cirrhosis data: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/878/cirrhosis+patient+survival+prediction+dataset-1>

Describe the data here in words for your audience if you want...


## Do Any Preliminary Tidying You Want

Maybe you want to work with some factors?  Rename some columns?  Change the scale of a value?


## Show a Snapshot of the Data

We haven't really talked about this, but you can use functions like `head()` or `summary()` to show some overall information about a data frame.
