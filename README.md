# First Steps in R and RStudio Exercises

This repository holds exercise and solutions files related to the [First Steps in R and RStudio Skills Series](https://arcus.github.io/first_steps_in_r_rstudio_skills_series/index.html) offered by Arcus Education.

Here is a breakdown of some of the topics covered in each exercise:

## Session 2

* Source and Visual buttons in the RStudio IDE
* The green "play" button that executes code chunks in the RStudio IDE
* Loading the `tidyverse` package using `library`
* Verbose output that can happen from loading packages
* Loading a library allows you to use its functions
* Using the `read_csv` function to ingest a csv file
* Working with the Environment tab in the RStudio IDE
  - Blue triangle beside data frames
  - Clicking on the names of data frames
* Good names for objects (variables, columns) in R
* `head`, `tail`, `summary` as ways to examine an object in R
* R often has multiple ways to do the same thing
* Help in R and reading help documentation
* Rendering a Quarto document

## Session 3

* Using chunk options like warning=FALSE and message=FALSE
* The grammar of graphics in ggplot2:
  - Start with a tidy data frame
  - Add a geometric representation
  - Add aesthetic mappings
* Working with histogram binwidth "error" message
* You don't necessarily have to pass labels for every argument
* "color" (0-1D) vs "fill" (2D) in ggplot2
* Mapping color vs setting color
* Adding labels using `labs`
* Using palettes (in particular, `scale_color_brewer`)
* Specifying exact colors (in particular, `scale_fill_manual`)
* Using `position` (stacking vs side-by-side)
* Using `alpha` (transparency)
* Faceting

## Session 4

* Naming code chunks
* Using the code chunk navigator in the RStudio IDE
* Data types in R
* `str()` to look at data types (mirrored with blue triangle in Environment tab)
* `View()` to look within data frame (mirrored with clicking name in Environment tab)
* Factors in R
* Using `mutate` to transform variables to factors (including ordered)
* Using `select` and `filter` to subset data

## Session 5

* Hands on work!
